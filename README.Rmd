The goal of traj2 is to implements the three-step procedure proposed by Leffondree et al. (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal trajectories. The procedure involves (1) calculating a number of measures of change capturing various features of the trajectories; (2) using a PCA-based dimensionality reduction algorithm to select a subset of measures and (3) using the K-means clustering algorithm to identify clusters of trajectories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of traj2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IcatianTrout/traj2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(traj2)
#data = trajdata

#mes = step1measures(data, ID=TRUE)
#sel = step2selection(mes)

#sel$loadings

#sel2 = step2selection(mes,select=c(10,12,8,4))

#clus <- step3(sel2,nclusters=4)$partition

#plot.traj(clus)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
